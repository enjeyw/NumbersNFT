# Numbers 

The concept is simple:
- There are 10,000 numbers available: 0 - 9999
- Rarity is native. Low Numbers? Primes? Dates? Make of it what you will.
- Mint order is pseudo-random. The order is deterministically generated from an initial seed, with a maximum of 1 mint per block.
- The artwork is the Number. Obviously.
- What can you do with them? Whatever can you do with numbers.
